# Movies-Rating-System

The community maintained a list of **Movie Rating System**.


## About The Project

There are many great movie rating system available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a Movie Rating System  so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a Movie Rating System from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
